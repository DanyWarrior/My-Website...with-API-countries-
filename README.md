# My-Website...with-API-countries-

*** To run the project ***
. Open Visual Studio Code and use Live Server extension




*** Project Description ***
. In my project you will be able to navigate and find all the countries in the world, see their names and flags, but you also will be able to do more. If you click on any of them you will have the possibility of reading a description of it, which will be information that you may not know.
. There is a search bar that you can use to filter the country that you are interested even quicker, and see its description or info.
. You'll have access to my GitHub account, and be able to know me better and Contact Me if you like.




*** Identify 3+ features from the provided list that you've integrated ***
----------------------------------------------------------
1 feature from the ... Second Set of Features.
----------------------------------------------------------
. Retrieve data from a
 third-party API and use it to
 display something within your
 app.

(I use this feature calling an API
with this url: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all )



----------------------------------------------------------
3 features from the ... First  Set of Features
----------------------------------------------------------
. Use arrays, objects, sets or
 maps to store and retrieve
 information that is displayed
 in your app.

. Analyze data that is stored in
 arrays, objects, sets or maps
 and display information about
 it in your app.

. Visualize data in a user
 friendly way. (e.g. graph,
 chart, etc)

. Use a regular expression to
 validate user input and either
 prevent the invalid input or
 inform the user about it (in all
 cases prevent invalid input
 from being stored or saved).

(After the API call I started creating
elements in the HTML file using the DOM in JavaScript,
elements like divs, a, and p
utilizing the API as the main source)
